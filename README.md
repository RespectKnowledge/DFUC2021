# DFUC2021 MICCAI Challenge
These codes are tested using DFUC2021 MICCAI challenege dataset.
Initial, We have used the different pretrained models such as ResNet18, DensNet and efficientNet on preprocessed DFUC2021 dataset.
After different experiments, the vision transformer based models are applied on this challenege dataset and get resaonable performance.
The two different pretrained transformer used to extract the features and afterthis the pairwise concantenation of features has been applied before classification
Please check the model file for further explanation.
